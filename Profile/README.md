## What is ChelonianGall?

July 11, 2022, [CodinGame](https://codingame.com) discontinued their webchat after years of good services, arguing it was complicated to maintain and moderate. Which was true. But instead of replacing it with a better version, they decided to delete it completely and to rely only on their Discord server. A perfect trade from their point of view. But sadly they missed the point.

As a mater of fact, the Discord solution has some huge problems:
- It's not integrated on the site. Which is problematic for both visibility (for new users) and UX.
- Some users do not want to create a Discord account, mainly for privacy reasons.
- A lot of users used to connect to the chat from school/work and Discord is blocked in lot of these places.
- In the “Clash of Code” mode a new chat room was created for each game, which Discord can not handle.

ChelonianGall is here to offer a community driven alternative to Discord that handle some of these problems:
- The inscription only require a nickname and a password.
- The use of XMPP and of a dedicated domain name drastically reduce the risk to see it blocked by a firewall.
- An user script to integrate our webchat directly on CodinGame is under development.
