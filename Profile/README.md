## What is ChelonianGall?

July 11, 2022, [CodinGame](https://codingame.com) discontinued their webchat after years of good services, arguing it was complicated to maintain and moderate. Which was true. But instead of reworking/remade it, they decided to delete it completely and to rely only on their Discord server. A perfect trade from their point of view. But sadly they missed the point.

As a mater of fact, the Discord solution has some huge problems:
- It's not integrated on the site. Which is problematic for both visibility (for new users) and UX.
- Some users do not want to create a Discord account, mainly for privacy reasons.
- A lot of users used to connect to the chat from school/work and Discord is blocked in lot of these places.
- In the "Clash of Code" mode a new chat room was created for each game, which Discord can not handle.

ChelonianGall takes the form of a [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) server coupled with a dedicated webchat. The project goal is to offer a community driven alternative to the CodinGame's Discord server while solving some of the above-mentioned problems:
- The inscription only require a nickname and a password.
- The use of XMPP and of a dedicated domain name drastically reduce the risk to see it blocked by a firewall.
- An [user script](https://greasyfork.org/en) to integrate our webchat directly on CodinGame is under development.

Don't hesitate to join us!

## Project status

The XMPP server is up and can be reached trough the dedicated webchat located at [cheloniangall.com](https://cheloniangall.com/) or via your favorite [XMPP client](https://xmpp.org/software/clients/).

We are currently working on a full new design for the webchat in the form of a right-sided column, as was the CodinGame's one. Then, we plan to create an user script to allow the integration of our chat on CodinGame.

After that, the next step will be to save our dear friend [Automaton2000](https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/), and to give him his right place among us.

An overview of the project status is [available](https://github.com/orgs/ChelonianGall/projects/1) here.
