<h2>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT</h2>
<p>
  Hey there.<br/><br/>
  This is just a message to announce that I will shutdown definitely ChelonianGall after the CodinGame Fall Challenge.<br/><br/>
  What's following is just an explanation of the 'why', you can stop the reading here if you don't care.<br/><br/>
  First, I started this project because, as a lot of people, I was thinking that the CodinGame's chat deletion was a bad move. But most of the people who complained about the chat disapearance didn't came on ChelonianGall, or created an account and never used it. Perhaps they encountered problems, perhaps the chat was not at their taste, I don't know, I never got any feedback from them. To be clear: I'm not mad at them at all, I just think that's a shame. Anyway the result is that only a few people use ChelonianGall.<br/><br/>
  Second, that's a lot of work and it takes me a lot of time. I was aware of that when I started the development, but I thought it was worth the effort. Though, I made anything open source and asked for help to anyone who was ready to put the hands in. Nobody answered. Once again, I have no grudge against the people who used ChelonianGall without helping, they all have other things to do and I have no problems wirh that. But the fact is I'm assuming all the work alone for a really little amount of users. Not sure it's really worth it finally.<br/><br/>
  Third, it has a cost. Not a huge one, but still. Considering that I pay it from my pocket, the current economic situation, and the minimal use of ChelonianGall, I'm not sure it's well used money.<br/><br/>
  And finally, even if I had some problems with CodinGame, the project was meant for the Community, not to be a continuation of a stupid war between CodinGame and some users. But ChelonianGall is now used as a pretext by some idots that I will not name in an ego war, Codingame vs ChelonianGall, and I don't want to be part of that anymore. I'm done with that bullshits.<br/><br/>
  If anyone is interested in saving all or part of the project, the repositories are available on Github. I can also transfer the ownership of the whole project, just ask me. In any cases I'll delete them after the contest.<br/><br/>
  I'm OK with all of that. I tried something, it didn't work, not a big deal. In fact I'm pretty relieved to stop it.<br/><br/>
  That's all folks. Kisses.<br/><br/>

<h2>What is ChelonianGall?</h2>
<p>
  July 11, 2022, <a href = "https://www.codingame.com">CodinGame</a> discontinued their webchat after years of good services. <a href = "https://cheloniangall.com/">ChelonianGall</a> is here to replace it!<br/><br/>
  Here you will find a chat server reachable with the <a href = "https://xmpp.org/software/clients/">XMPP client</a> of your choice as well as with the dedicated webchat, but also an <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/453839-cheloniangall">user script</a> to integrate this webchat on CodinGame!<br/><br/>
  If you do not know how to use all this stuff, do not hesitate to check the <a href="https://cheloniangall.com/faq.php">FAQ</a>.
</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>
  While continuing to improve the webchat and its integration on CodinGame, the next step will be to save our dear friend <a href = "https://www.codingame.com/blog/markov-chain-automaton2000/">Automaton2000</a> and to give him his right place among us.
</p>
